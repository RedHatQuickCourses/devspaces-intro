= Architecture

This section will briefly cover the high-level architecture and components of Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces.

Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces runs (as a set of managed containers) on top of the OpenShift Container Platform, and delegates several responsibilities around security, user management, resource allocation and multi-tenancy to the underlying base platform.

== High Level Components

The product consists of a set of components interacting with each other to provide the necessary functionality for a web-based IDE.

== Dev Spaces operator

The OpenShift Dev Spaces operator managed the lifecycle of the  **Dev Spaces server** components. The following are the important points to note:

**OpenShift Dev Spaces controller**::
Creates and controls the necessary OpenShift objects to run a OpenShift Dev Spaces instance, such as pods, services, and persistent volumes.

**CheCluster custom resource (CR)**::
On a cluster with the OpenShift Dev Spaces operator installed, you will create a CheCluster custom resource (CR). The OpenShift Dev Spaces operator ensures the full lifecycle management of the OpenShift Dev Spaces server components on this OpenShift Dev Spaces instance:
+
* Dev Workspace operator
* Gateway
* User dashboard
* Devfile registries
* Dev Spaces server
* Plug-in registry

== Dev Workspace operator

The Dev Workspace operator extends OpenShift API to provide **DevWorkspaces** objects, a Custom Resource specialized for development environment provisioning. The following are the important points to note:

Dev Workspace custom resource definition::
Creates Dev Workspace OpenShift objects from **Devfile** specifications.

Dev Workspace controller::
Creates and controls the necessary OpenShift objects to run a Dev Workspace, such as pods, services, and persistent volumes.

== User dashboard

The user dashboard is a web application to launch *Workspaces*. It lets authenticated users create, manage, stop or delete **DevWorkspaces**. It parses and converts a **Devfile** provided by an authenticated user into OpenShift Custom Resources.

== Devfile registries

Workspaces are created using **Devfiles**. Devfiles are YAML configuration files stored in a Git repository. The OpenShift Dev Spaces Devfile registry provides a list of sample Devfiles to create workspaces. The User dashboard displays the samples list on the Dashboard. Each sample includes a **Devfile**.

== Dev Spaces server

The OpenShift Dev Spaces server is responsible for:

* Creating user namespaces for each workspace launched from the User Dashboard
* Provisioning required secrets and config maps
* Integrating with Git services providers, to fetch and validate Devfiles and perform authentication
* Providing a REST API for other components and external services

== Plug-in registry

Each OpenShift Dev Spaces workspace starts with a specific editor and set of associated IDE extensions. The OpenShift Dev Spaces plugin registry provides the list of available editors and editor extensions.

== User workspaces

A **Workspace** is composed of Pods, Services, Ingresses, Storage Volumes and other OpenShift objects. These resources enable developers to code, test, build, debug and deploy applications using a web based IDE. User workspaces are web IDEs running in containers.

A OpenShift Dev Spaces workspace contains the source code of the projects, persisted in an OpenShift Persistent Volume (PV). Dev Spaces components and services have read-write access to this shared directory.

The Devfile is used to specify the tools and runtime applications in a OpenShift Dev Spaces workspace.

== Gateway

The OpenShift Dev Spaces gateway, based on the open source https://traefik.io/traefik[Traefik] cloud-native API gateway and proxy server, has the following roles:

* Routing requests from end users.
* Authenticating users with _OpenID Connect (OIDC)_. It uses the _OpenShift OAuth2_ proxy.
* Applying OpenShift Role based access control (RBAC) policies to control access to any OpenShift Dev Spaces resource.

It controls access to the following components:

* User dashboard
* Devfile registries
* Dev Spaces server
* Plug-in registry
* User workspaces
