<p>Developer Productivity</p>

<p>Challenges in reproducing production environment in development/QA</p>

<li>
<p>For modern cloud-native applications, production is on Kubernetes/OpenShift, while development happens on laptops and workstations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Devs have programming knowledge, but little experience with containers and Kubernetes/OpenShift in production</p>

<p>It is complex and difficult to switch between different projects having different stacks and different versions of programming language runtime environments</p>

<p>Legacy Hardware and security challenges</p>

<p>More and more requirements and regulatory pressure to develop in secure and controlled environments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Virtual Desktop Interface (VDI) solutions are slow and painful for developers, making them less agile and effective</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With the increasing capabilities provided by the cloud and modern Javascript front-end user interfaces to host applications of all types, it makes sense to explore the concept of a portable, cloud-based developer environment that can be accessed by a diverse group of developers spread over multiple geographies, with just a modern browser.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Enter the concept of a <strong>Cloud Development Environment</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>According to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/cloud-development-environments-cdes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gartner</a>:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
Cloud development environments (CDEs) provide software developers with remote, ready-to-use access to a cloud-hosted development environment with minimal effort for setup and configuration. They comprise elements of a traditional IDE, such as code editing, debugging, code review, and code collaboration. They also provide consistent, secure developer access to preconfigured development workspaces. This frees them from setting up their own local environments, eliminating the need to install and maintain dependencies, software development kits, security patches, and plug-ins. Their seamless integration with Git-based repositories and continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) tools enhances developer productivity and developer experience. CDEs provide a scalable way to support a distributed workforce and hybrid work environments.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The advantages of a CDE are as follows:</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Near-instant provisioning of developer environments, on-demand for a new developer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ability to reproduce cloud-native production environments in development (to speedy releases, and reduce the cliché of <em>“but, it works on my machine!&#8230;&#8203;”</em>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bring the day-to-day tasks that a developer does on his local machine (writing code, testing, debugging, and more), to a web-based IDE to improve the same developer experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seamless switching between different projects with different stacks and different versions of programming language runtimes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Centralized security and access to source code backed by enterprise security standards (OAuth/OIDC, TLS)</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces</strong> is a cloud development environment (CDE) service for the OpenShift Container Platform. It provides a container-based integrated development environment (IDE) with a consistent, secure, and zero-configuration approach. The experience is as smooth, fast, and familiar as an integrated development environment (IDE) on your laptop.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces is built on top of the open source <a href="https://eclipse.dev/che" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eclipse Che</a> project. Using Dev Spaces on OpenShift, source code never leaves IT-secured servers, but developers still have their development “sandbox.”</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following are the notable features of the product:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>VS Code and JetBrains IDEs in the browser</strong> - OpenShift Dev Spaces includes <strong>Microsoft Visual Studio Code - Open Source</strong> and <strong>JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA</strong>. You can choose which IDE to run in your cloud development environments. You need a machine capable of running a modern web browser to code, build, test, deploy, and debug on OpenShift. Administrators and developers can customize their Dev Spaces instance to support multiple programming language environments. Each developer gets his own dedicated <strong>Workspace</strong> to work with source code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Developer workspaces defined as code</strong> - Customize your workspaces using a YAML file (called a <strong>Devfile</strong>). The development environments are defined as code, which makes them consistent and eliminates "works on my machine" issues. You can customize the following:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Resource allocation (CPU, Memory, and Storage)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pre-defined commands to build, test, debug, and run code</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Containers with development tools</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Containers or Kubernetes manifest for services required for testing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Workspace start and stop events let you further customize your environment on entry and exit</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Source code repositories (Git) integration. You can push and pull code to and from Git repositories from within the workspace.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enterprise integration</strong> - The cloud development environments run inside the organization network, and the source code access is secured using the same tools used across the rest of the organization. Workspaces can be automatically configured with enterprise proxy and trusted TLS certificate bundles. Access to the workspaces is secured using OpenShift OAuth and allows LDAP or Active Directory (AD). Administrators can easily manage and monitor workspaces as any other Kubernetes resource.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Kubernetes/OpenShift development made easy</strong> - Build and test cloud-native applications on OpenShift without having to configure access credentials manually. Development environments run on OpenShift, and are pre-configured with developer credentials.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ready-to-use Templates based on Red Hat technologies</strong> - Leverage the bundled well-tested, certified container images for popular stacks (programming language environments) as the base for your enterprise-grade applications. Use images as is, or customize them further to adapt to your needs. You can maintain custom images and Devfiles in your own Devfile registry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Efficient image builds with fuse-overlays storage driver</strong> - enable faster builds and more optimized storage usage for <code>podman build</code> and <code>buildah</code> tools within your Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces workspace.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces is based on the upstream, open source Eclipse Che project, there are several key differences:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Red Hat provides subscriptions, QA, and packaging to ensure enterprise-level support for Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces. See <a href="https://access.redhat.com/node/3877301" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces life-cycle and support policy</a> for details</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dev Spaces is supported only on Red Hat OpenShift</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dev Spaces is based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and is regularly updated to include the latest security fixes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dev Spaces provides several useful Devfiles by default, for working with languages and technologies such as Quarkus, Spring Boot, Javascript/Node.js, Ruby, Python, DotNet, Go, C/C++, PHP, and more</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dev Spaces uses OpenShift OAuth for user login and management by default</p>
